I have a list of TODOs in `TODO.md`.

Continue with the remaining tasks in `TODO.md` one by one, starting with the
simplest. For each task

1. Plan the implementation.
2. Execute the changes.
3. Verify the changes (if possible).
4. Mark the task as completed in `TODO.md`.
5. Git commit the changes.
