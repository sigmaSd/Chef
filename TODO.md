- [x] if the latest version is the same as the current version, the Update
      button should be called soemthing else maybe Reinstall

- [x] add a run in terminal button

- [x] if an app is running we should have visual feedback in the app, it should
      be easy to tell if teh app is running and listen to its exit

- I just disoverd Gtk ColumnView it seems a perfect fit instead of the current
  usage of Gtk Grid port to it

- [x] The current chef version beign used should be displayed in the ui, this
      might be tricky be cause we need to parse teh chefpath js file right ?

- [ ] The install/reinstall button maybe shoukld be at the right of teh actions
      ? because when it disapers (when the prgoream runs) the other gets shifted
      left

- [ ] Use gtk blueprint to reduce this too much imperative code
