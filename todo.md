- [x] instead of Chef native apps we should callt the mcjust Chef apps, also in
      the gui providers should have first letter uppercased, maybe bold the word
      as well
- [x] the update only button should only show up if there are uupdates, also it
      should be more eye catching laybe by having that yellow udpate emoji or
      beiing yellow choose whats best
- [x] I want a button that takes me to another view in the app, this veiw shows
      all chef logs live, so all thats beigin pritned in the terminal is being
      streamed live in this view
