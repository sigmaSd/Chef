## Guidelines

Start with the easiest tasks or those with dependencies. Complete them one by
one, summarizing work and obtaining user confirmation before removing the item.
Note completed items in PROGRESS.md and update task descriptions as
implementation details evolve.

## Upcoming Tasks

- [ ] Detect new updates while in the background and notify the user.

- [ ] Add a setting to enable/disable background notification behavior.
