- [x] reinstall/remove feedback is hidden in more options popup so teh user
      doesnt notice it, maybe status column should indicate if soemthing is
      happening
- [x] when removing an app from the provider it works, but installing it again
      fails, it fails like this ❌ Recipe "irust" not found, I'm not sure if
      this require specail support from the client, tell me what do you think
      about this part
- [x] wehn teh app first oepns the table is empty , we need some ui feedback
      here, maybe some live messages about what we're doing
